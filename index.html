	  <img class="youth"src="https://i.postimg.cc/K87vBRKx/template.png" alt="We are a youth leadership movement"/>
	  <p>AIESEC is a global platform for young people to explore and develop their leadership potential. We are a non-political, independent, not-for-profit organisation run by students and recent graduates of institutions of higher education. Its members are interested in world issues, leadership and management. AIESEC does not discriminate on the basis of ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, religion or national/social origin.
	    Since we were founded, we have engaged and developed over 1,000,000 young people who have been through an AIESEC experience. The impact of our organisation can be seen through our alumni who represent business, NGO and world leaders, including one Nobel Peace Prize laureate, Martti Ahtisaari of Finland.</p>
	  <h3>What does AIESEC stand for?</h3>
	  <hr class="thick">
	  <p>How do you ensure that every member of AIESEC will become a leader of positive impact?<br><br>By providing every member of AIESEC a set of core values that we live by everyday. We are able to develop the leadership potential of young people by engaging them early-on with a values-based environment that shapes their behaviours. We enable young people to build a strong foundation of core values as they develop into responsible and entrepreneurial young leaders. Enabling them to be empowered to carry these AIESEC values throughout their lives in making more responsible decisions that will positively impact the world.</p>
	  <h3>Youth run</h3>
	  <hr class="thick">
	  <p>We are a global network of young leaders under the age of 30 who strive to better themselves and the communities around them. We are passionate about world issues, leadership development, cultural understanding and experiential learning.
	    The organisation spans 126 countries and territories and every aspect of AIESEC’s operations are managed by students and recent graduates.
	    We have operated in this way since our inception, making us uniquely “by young people, for young people”, for over 65 years. The global leadership teams are elected by the membership annually.</p>
	  <h3>Origins</h3>
	  <hr class="thick">
	  <p>AIESEC was founded in 1948 in 7 countries in Europe by Jean Choplin (France), Bengt Sjøstrand (Sweden), and Dr. Albert Kaltenthaler (Germany). Over 65 years later we are present in 126 countries and territories.</p>
	  <h3>Who can be an AIESECer?</h3>
	  <hr class="thick">
	  <p>Anyone who believes in the AIESEC vision, supports the mission of AIESEC, and lives by the AIESEC values is a part of the youth leadership movement, and hence is an AIESECer. They can be our partners who relate to our organizational values and vision, or it can be our parents who constantly support us to give our best to our leadership development journeys.</p>
